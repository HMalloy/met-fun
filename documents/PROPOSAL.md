# Fun with the Met

I would like to create a simple, responsive website showcasing art and artists from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's unrestricted API. Because the Met already has a lovely and responsive website, I would create very simple UI that serves up a piece at random with facts about the art and artist.  

## API URL

Using the [Met API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) to display art, artists, and other data.

### From the Met API documentation

"The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use. To the extent possible under law, The Metropolitan Museum of Art has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this dataset using the Creative Commons Zero license."
