# The Metropolitan Museum of Art

I would like to create a simple, responsive website showcasing art and artists from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's unrestricted API. Because the Met already has a lovely and responsive website, I would create a very simple UI that serves up an art piece at random with facts about the art and artist. I have a background in fine art, and wanted to do something that could bring joy, is simple and informative.

## API URL

Using the [Met API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) to display art, artists, and other data.
